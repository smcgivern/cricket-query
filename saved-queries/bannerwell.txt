Bannerwell
The Bannerwell (Bannerman / Bakewell) is the proportion of runs made in a completed team innings. In the very first men's Test innings, Charles Bannerman made 165 out of 245 for 67%, a record which still stands in men's Tests today. Enid Bakewell bettered that in a women's Test in 1979, with 68% of her team's score.
