Most consecutive wins batting or fielding first
This shows the most consecutive wins batting or fielding first by format, across all teams. For instance, if team A wins batting first, then teams B and C draw, then team A wins batting first, then team B wins batting first, that's a streak of one win, followed by no streak, followed by a streak of two wins.
